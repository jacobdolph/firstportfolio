            <p>Hello, I am a web developer in training. Originally from Texas, I now live in Cottonwood Heights near
                salt lake city, Utah. I enjoy spending time with my family, going to movies, hiking, snowboarding and
                finding hot springs around the edges of
                the valley. I am currently learning JavaScript and adding to my toolbelt new languages and frameworks.
                <br>
                <br>
                After highschool I went to film school in Orlando, Florida. I loved being able to tell stories and
                create experiences for
                an audience but ultimately never found real fullfilment out of it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started working at Starbucks to pass the time while living in Texas and one day some friends of mine
                decided to move to Park City, Utah. Not knowing much about the place I hopped on the truck to become a
                ski bum. After many years in retail I thought I would give a career change a shot and took a couple of
                courses at Pluralsight. This is where I found out that I like the challenge of solving the puzzle that
                is coding. I get much satisfaction from solving a problem after hours of banging my head against the
                keyboard.</p>
